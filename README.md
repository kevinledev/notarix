### Overall Design
![Design](static/design.png)

## Starting a dev environment
1. install dapp-launchpad globally:
`npm install -g @polygonlabs/dapp-launchpad`

2. run the command
`dapp-launchpad dev`


## Smart Contract Development

### Overview of the NotaryPayment Contract:
The smart contract, **NotaryPayment.sol**, was developed to handle payments in USDC. The contract allows users to pay a fee in USDC, which is required for the notarization of their documents. The core functions of the contract include:
- **payFee()**: Enables users to transfer USDC from their wallet to the contract in exchange for the notarization service.
- **withdrawFunds()**: Allows the owner to withdraw all collected USDC from the contract.


### Deployment Process:
The smart contract was deployed using **Hardhat**, on the **Polygon Amoy testnet**. The deployment process involved:
1. Writing and compiling the contract in Solidity.
2. Creating deployment scripts to automate the deployment on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
3. Verifying the contractâ€™s functionality by interacting with it via the frontend application.

### Choice of Polygon Network:
Polygon was selected due to its low transaction fees and high scalability, which are essential for consumer-facing applications like Notarix, as users can interact with the smart contract without encountering high fees typical on the Ethereum network.

### Integration of USDC for Payments:
USDC (Circle) is the primary currency collected from users in the notary service. By using USDC, the contract ensures a consistent payment experience for users. The **NotaryPayment.sol** contract collects fees directly in USDC from users when they submit documents for notarization.
